# R Markdown for Medicine: From Data to Manuscript

This repo contains materials for the R Markdown for Medicine workshop, to be offered at the [R/Medicine 2019 conference](https://r-medicine.com/). 

# Abstract

Join us for a 90-minute workshop that will take you on a tour of how to get from data to manuscript using R Markdown. Starting with a mock medical dataset, we'll use R Markdown to combine prose, R code, and figures and tables created with R code into a nicely formatted and reproducible final manuscript. 
 
The workshop will be 90 minutes and taught on rstudio.cloud, and will focus on three topics:

1. R Markdown basics

1. Adding graphics

1. Adding tables


## R Markdown basics

You'll start with a mock medical dataset, and jump right into an R Markdown project. You'll knit a report to analyze and visualize the data. Along the way, you'll learn about key concepts like YAML, pandoc, markdown, knitr, output options, and output formats- and how you can use all of them in your medical research. 

## Adding graphics

You'll take an R Markdown report, and learn how to add graphics to your knitted report. You'll learn `ggplot2` basics around plots and layering, `knitr` code chunk options to improve graphics presentation, and packages for sewing together multiple plots into a multipanel figure. 

## Adding tables

You will learn how to knit a "Table 1" using medical data into an R Markdown document, and how to customize a table to report common summary statistics for studies with multiple arms.
