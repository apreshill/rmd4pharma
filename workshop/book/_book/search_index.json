You can use anything that Pandoc’s Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). The bookdown package can be installed from CRAN or Github: install.packages(&quot;bookdown&quot;) # or the development version # devtools::install_github(&quot;rstudio/bookdown&quot;) Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading #. To compile this example to PDF, you need XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.name/tinytex/. knitr::include_graphics(here::here(&quot;rmed-2019/images/fogg-list-is-empty.png&quot;)) metadata (= YAML), → either rmarkdown (for params) or pandoc text (= Markdown), [but inline code is processed by rmarkdown r] R code (= knitr), [other code too! Today we use for R, but I do want you to know…] Output (control with knitr code chunk options). Formative assessments focus on “if I want to change X, what do I search for?” Activity: Open a new Rmd file- read through it- knit it. → for each activity, do it first (model), then they do (build up muscle memory for knitting bc they’ll have done it like 50 times throughout workshop) start with prewritten script and work from there- fill in…. nice warmup activity- get in groups, introduce, work through script, what does it do? Annotate, narrate. "],
