Today we use for R, but I do want you to know…] Output (control with knitr code chunk options). Formative assessments focus on “if I want to change X, what do I search for?” Activity: Open a new Rmd file- read through it- knit it. → for each activity, do it first (model), then they do (build up muscle memory for knitting bc they’ll have done it like 50 times throughout workshop) start with prewritten script and work from there- fill in…. nice warmup activity- get in groups, introduce, work through script, what does it do? Annotate, narrate. "],
