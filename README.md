# R Markdown for Medicine: From Data to Manuscript

This repo contains materials for the R Markdown for Medicine workshop, to be offered at the [R/Medicine 2019 conference](https://r-medicine.com/). 

# Abstract


Join us for a 90-minute workshop that will take you on a tour of how to get from data to manuscript using R Markdown. Starting with a mock medical dataset, we'll use R Markdown to combine prose, R code, and figures and tables created with R code into a nicely formatted and reproducible final manuscript. 

 
The workshop will be 4 hours (with breaks!) and taught on rstudio.cloud, and will focus on three topics:

1. R Markdown basics

2. Adding graphics

3. Adding tables

## Intended Audience

## Expected Experience

1. R Experience

You have downloaded and used R a bit, and hopefully used the tidyverse packages including ggplot and dplyr. Even better if you have tried out the rmarkdown package and knit a document.

2. RStudio Experience

You have downloaded and used  RStudio, and you are familiar with the various windows, how to install and load packages, and the basics of the Environment, History, Files, Plots, Packages, and Console tabs. You should know the difference between interactive coding in the Console and scripting in the script window. You should know how to create a Project in RStudio, and the advantages of doing so. 

3. Medical Manuscript Experience

We expect that you have collaborated with others on, or written your own medical manuscript at some point, which likely included a Table 1, other tables, plots and graphs, and lots of text and citations.

4. R Markdown Experience

Not much!


## R Markdown basics

You'll start with a mock medical dataset, and jump right into an R Markdown project. You'll knit a report to analyze and visualize the data. Along the way, you'll learn about key concepts like YAML, pandoc, markdown, knitr, output options, and output formats- and how you can use all of them in your medical research. 

## Adding graphics

You'll take an R Markdown report, and learn how to add graphics to your knitted report. You'll learn `ggplot2` basics around plots and layering, `knitr` code chunk options to improve graphics presentation, and packages for sewing together multiple plots into a multipanel figure. 

## Adding tables

You will learn how to knit a "Table 1" using medical data into an R Markdown document, and how to customize a table to report common summary statistics for studies with multiple arms.
